 I am an Assistant Adjunct Professor (i.e. a postdoc) in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA, working with [Wotao Yin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/). My work lies in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing and optimization. I am particularly interested in devising new algorithms for old problems that scale efficiently to large data sets. My recent and ongoing projects include:
 <ul>
  <li> Using compressed sensing to devise new approaches to high-dimensional zeroth order optimization. </li>
  <li> Using path metrics to get a handle on high-dimensional point clouds, particularly when they are sampled from a low dimensional manifold. </li>
  <li> Deep learning, particularly implicit neural networks. </li>
  </ul>

I received my PhD from the University of Georgia in May 2019, under the supervision of [Ming-Jun Lai](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~mjlai/). Prior to that I was an undergraduate at the University of Cape Town, from where I also received my Master's degree. In between Cape Town and Athens, Georgia I spent a semester at the University of Bayreuth working with [Fabrizio Catanese](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_Catanese).   

 I enjoy teaching upper and lower division courses, and strive to make my classrooms a welcoming space for all. Lately I have been thinking a lot about best practice for teaching data science related courses. You can find more information on my teaching page.

You can reach me at [my surname]@math.ucla.edu. My physical address is Office 5346, Mathematical Sciences Building, 520 Portola Plaza, Los Angeles, 90095.
