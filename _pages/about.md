Welcome! I am a postdoc in the Department of Mathematics at UCLA, working with [Wotao Yin](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wotaoyin/). I am interested in the intersection of machine learning, signal processing and optimization. I received my PhD from the University of Georgia in May 2019, under the supervision of [Ming-Jun Lai](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~mjlai/). Prior to that I was an undergraduate at the University of Cape Town, from where I also received my Master's degree. In between Cape Town and Athens, Georgia I spent a semester at the University of Bayreuth working with [Fabrizio Catanese](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabrizio_Catanese).
