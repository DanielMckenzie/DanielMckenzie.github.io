(<i> 2020--2021 </i>) At UCLA I co-developed Math151AH and Math151BH, honors versions of the pre-existing applied numerical methods classes. This two course sequence examines the theory and implementation of algorithms to solve fundamental problems in numerical analysis, for example least squares and SVD decompositions.
We used [this](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691146867/numerical-analysis) textbook. Here are the syllabi for [Math151AH](../files/Syllabus_151AH.pdf) and [Math151AH](../files/Syllabus_151BH.pdf), and [here](../files/Slides_Lecture_11_and_12.pdf) is a sample lecture on one of my favorite algorithms, the power method.
