Math 32A is a large (~200 students), one-quarter course on multivariable calculus. Teaching Math 32A was an interesting experience as it involved giving auditorium-style lectures as well as managing a grader and three TA's who met with the students in smaller groups. You can find a copy of the syllabus [here](../files/syllabus-32A.pdf). The [reviews](https://www.bruinwalk.com/professors/daniel-mckenzie/math-32a/) were mostly favorable.
