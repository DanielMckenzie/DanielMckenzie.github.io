(<i> 2014--2019 </i>) While a graduate student at UGA I taught Math1113, a one semester precalculus course, six times. The textbook we used was <i> Precalculus </i> by Julie Miller and Donna Gerkin. For some sections we used the ALEKS homework system. You can find a sample syllabus [here](../files/Syllabus23880.pdf) and a copy of my first day of class slides [here](../files/FDOC_15359.pdf).
