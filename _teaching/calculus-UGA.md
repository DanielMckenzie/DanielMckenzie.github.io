(<i> 2014--2019 </i>) While a graduate student at UGA I taught Math2250, a one semester Calculus 1 course, three times. We used the textbook <i> University Calculus, Early Transcendentals</i> by Hass, Weir and Thomas. We used the WebWork homework system. I experimented with a variety of teaching modalities but one thing I found to be effective was creating a worksheet for every lesson which we would start in class and students would finish at home. You can find an example of such a worksheet [here](../files/applications_of_chain_rule.pdf). You can find a copy of the syllabus [here](../files/Mckenzie_Math2250_Spring2019_Syllabus.pdf).
