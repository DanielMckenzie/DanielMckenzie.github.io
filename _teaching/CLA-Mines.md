A graduate course on numerical linear algebra. We will focus on three fundamental problems; solving linear systems, solving least squares problems, and finding eigenvalues/eigenvectors. We'll present multiple computational approaches for each. If you are a Mines student enrolled in this course you can find additional details on the canvas page.
