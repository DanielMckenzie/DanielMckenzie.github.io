(<i> 2019--2021 </i>) At UCLA I co-developed and then taught (three times) Math 118, an introduction to the mathematics of data science. I try to emphasize both theory and practice, so [some lectures](../files/118-SampleLecture-2.pdf) are slide-based presentations while [others](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13P-3rDpAEQwsf_JYX46EExsLNb3-ONnP?usp=sharing) are more interactive and use Jupyter notebooks to play around with algorithms. I am happy to share my complete set of lecture slides, but not yet willing to make them completely public, so email me if you would like access.
